## Getting started

- Sign up on [resin.io](https://dashboard.resin.io/signup)
- go throught the [getting started guide](http://docs.resin.io/raspberrypi/nodejs/getting-started/) and create a new RPI zero application called `boombeasticmini`
- clone this repository to your local workspace
- set these variables in the `Fleet Configuration` application side tab

  - `RESIN_HOST_CONFIG_dtoverlay` = `hifiberry-dac`

- add the _resin remote_ to your local workspace using the useful shortcut in the dashboard UI ![remoteadd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resin-io-playground/boombeastic/master/docs/gitresinremote.png)
- `git push resin master`
- see the magic happening, your device is getting updated Over-The-Air!
- after the OTA is completed, you should be able to point your browser to `<boombeasticIP>:80` (get the device IP from the resin dashboard)
- you can use any MPD client pointing it at `<boombeasticIP>:6680` (the port can be changed using `MOPIDY_MPD_PORT` env var)
